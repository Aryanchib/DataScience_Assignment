        "* The sample size is small (n = 15), and the population standard deviation is unknown. When the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, the t-distribution is used instead of the normal distribution to account for the increased uncertainty. The t-distribution is wider (more conservative) than the normal distribution, making it more appropriate in these situations.\n",

        "\n",
        "* 1) Shape: It looks like a bell curve, similar to the normal distribution, but with fatter tails. This means it accounts for more extreme values.\n",
        "* 2) Flexibility: It's useful when you don't know the population standard deviation and have to estimate it from your sample.\n",
        "* 3) Degrees of Freedom: The shape of the t-distribution changes based on the sample size (degrees of freedom). With larger samples, it starts to look more like the normal distribution.( ***do google graph of t-distribution and Z-distribution graph to get a proper insights of the data***)\n",
